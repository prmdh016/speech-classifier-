\f0\fs24 \cf0 I have cleaned the dataset, and categorised labels FAKE and REAL as my dependent variables
I have created a bag of words model to embedded the words as well as to identify the words with repetition, employed TF _IDF Term Frequency vectoriser\
\
For the classifier, initialised Passive Aggressive Classifier for better prediction of hate speech \
I have employed Naives bayes Classifier for model accuracy for performance but actual created PAC has performed better \
